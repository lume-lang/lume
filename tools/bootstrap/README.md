# Lume Bootstrap

`bootstrap` is the easiest way to get started with Lume. It allows for easy installation of multiple Lume toolchains,
which can be switched out at any time.

## Requirements

Since the Lume compiler is written in Rust, you need to have Rust installed on your system.
- Rust, version 1.88.0 or higher.
