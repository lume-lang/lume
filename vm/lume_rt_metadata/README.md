# `lume_rt_metadata`

Metadata structures for use in *runtime* execution. These structures are meant to match 1-1 with
their in-memory representation. This crate is distinct, and almost completely incompatible, with `lume_type_metadata`,
which only defines metadata structures for use in *compile time* usage.
