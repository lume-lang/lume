# Overview

Lume is programming language that aims to be simple, expressive, and efficient. It is designed to be a strongly-typed, language which provides a rich and flexible set of features for building robust and scalable applications.

At it's core, Lume follows a set of design principles:

- **Strongly-typed:** Every expression and statement has some resulting type. While types can be inferred, they are often explicitly declared, making it easier to comprehend and maintain code. Having a robust type system ensures that errors are caught before runtime.

- **Minimal:** Lume is designed to be minimalistic, with only a small set of keywords and a simple syntax. This makes it easy to learn and use, while still providing powerful features. On top of that, most of the the keywords can be used as any other identifier for variables, functions, etc.

- **Developer friendly:** Lume is meant to be the conduit for your software solutions; not the main focus of them. It therefore attempts to provide all the tools and utilities required for developers to focus on logic, instead of fighting the compiler and/or runtime.
