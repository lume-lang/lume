module Lume
  class Parser
    # Defines a module which has been parsed and optionally analyzed.
    #
    # Modules represent a "package" in Lume, where each package is some compilation unit, be it
    # a project, a single source or a library.
    #
    # Each module has a unique name, which is used to identify it within the system, the parsed HIR AST,
    # the analyzed MIR AST and some optional dependencies.
