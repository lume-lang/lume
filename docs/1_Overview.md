# Overview

Lume is programming language that aims to be simple, expressive, and efficient. It is designed to be a strongly-typed, language which provides a rich and flexible set of features for building robust and scalable applications.

At it's core, Lume follows a set of design principles:

- **Strongly-typed:** Every expression and statement has some resulting type. While types can be inferred, they are often explicitly declared, making it easier to comprehend and maintain code. Having a robust type system ensures that errors are caught before runtime.

- **Minimal:** Lume is designed to be minimalistic, with only a small set of reserved keywords and a simple syntax. This makes it easy to learn and use, while still providing powerful features.
