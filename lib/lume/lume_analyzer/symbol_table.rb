module Lume
  class Analyzer
    # Defines a single entry within the symbol table.
    #
    # Each symbol entry represents a node, which declares a symbol within the source. It can be variable declaration,
    # function definition or class definition. Each symbol also describes the following properties of the node:
    #   - `name`: The name of the symbol.
    #   - `type`: The type of the symbol, if applicable.
    #   - `node`: A reference to the underlying IR node.
    class SymbolEntry
      attr_accessor :name, :type, :node

      def initialize(name, type, node)
        @name = name
        @type = type
        @node = node
      end
    end

    # Represents a boundary between scopes, which cannot be crossed.
    #
    # Boundaries are only meant to be implemented when all symbols in the local scope should be hidden. This is most
    # often the case when calling a function or method, where the local scope is hidden.
    class Boundary; end

    # The symbol table keeps track of all symbols which are available within any given scope.
    #
    # This table binds variable references to their declarations, so code such as this:
    #
    #   let a = 1
    #   let b = a
    #
    # The expression `let a = 1` declares a new variable `a` and assigns it the value `1`. When the
    # expression `let b = a` is visited, it needs to know which variable is being referenced, when seeing `a`.
    #
    # Since this table needs to contain a lookup table of variables, it also needs to know which scope each
    # variable is declared in. Because of this, this table also inherently handles invalid variable references,
    # such as referencing a variable that has not been declared or variables which are out of scope. For example:
    #
    #   let a = b
    #
    # Would fail because `b` has not been declared yet. Similarly:
    #
    #   fn test()
    #     b = 1
    #   end
    #
    #   test()
    #
    #   let a = b
    #
    # Would fail because `b` is out of scope when `a` is declared, even though `b` was defined within `test`,
    # which was called before `a` was declared.
